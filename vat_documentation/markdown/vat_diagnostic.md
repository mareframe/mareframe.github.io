The visualizing [Atlantis](http://atlantis.cmar.csiro.au/) diagnostic tool, `vadt`, is developed by Christopher David Desjardins at the [Science Institute at the University of Iceland](http://raunvis.hi.is/rhformE.php) as a part of the [EU MareFrame project](http://www.mareframe-fp7.org/). The `vat` package is released under the [GPL v3 or later](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) and source code is available at [http://github.com/mareframe/vat](http://github.com/mareframe/vat).

At present, `vadt` is able to:
- Replicate the functionality of Olive
- Display animated GIFs showing changes in biomass over time for each functional group in the model created with the `animate_vadt` function.
- Plot structural, reserve, total numbers, length-at-age, and biomass disaggregated by age for each functional group
- Present diet information. For vertebrates, the units are number eaten per second and for invertebrates, the units are mg N/m3 eaten per second
- Present aggregated plots of vertebrates and invertebrates

To start the application, click a tab, e.g. **Spatial Plots**, etc. Then select the functional group you are interested. Some plots have tabs on the left side of the page which can be clicked (e.g. the Interactive Plots tab).
